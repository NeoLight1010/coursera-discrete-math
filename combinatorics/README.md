# Dice Game Project

This is my solution for the Dice Game problem.

## Description

Given a set of 6-side dices (and given the numbers on each face of each dice),
find the dice whose probability of winning is higher against all other dices.

If there isn't such best dice, then find the best rival for each dice.

Also, determine if the player should choose the dice first or second in order
to have the best probability to win.
